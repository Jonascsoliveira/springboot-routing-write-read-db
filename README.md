# About
A solution to access a mirrored databases wich includes operations of read and write data. With this you can persist data in a write database and get data form a read-only connection. When use @Tranctional(readOnly = true) annotation on a service that retrieve some info from database, this consult 
will be routed for read only database. When use only @Transactional annotation on a service, it means the operation will be routed for write database.
